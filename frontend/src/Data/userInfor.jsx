        description: "Hello, I'm Minghao Sun, a Computer Science master's student at the University of the Pacific, with a strong foundation in full-stack development and machine learning. I have hands-on experience in building responsive web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Flask, as well as integrating real-time communication with Socket.IO. I have also worked on AI-driven projects, fine-tuning large language models and implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). My recent internship involved optimizing front-end and back-end systems for applications deployed on AWS EC2, where I collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to ensure smooth API communication and real-time updates"
